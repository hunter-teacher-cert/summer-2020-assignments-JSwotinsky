4.11 Exercise 1
Jonathan Swotinsky

ping() adds a period to the end of the current line, and then starts a new line.
baffle() prints "wug" and then invokes ping().

OUTPUT:

No, I wug.
You wugga wug.
I wug.

STACK DIAGRAM:

main     
zoop   
baffle
ping

If baffle() is invoked at the end of ping(), the program gets caught in a loop printing "wug." until a StackOverflow exception is thrown.
